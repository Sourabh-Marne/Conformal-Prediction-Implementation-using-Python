# Applicability of Conformal Predictors for Transfer Learning

Developed a Python implementation of the Conformal Prediction Machine Learning algorithm with KNN-1 nearest neighbour for transfer learning. 

The project involved creating artificial datasets from scratch to assess the algorithm's performance under varying noise levels and data distribution shifts. 

The results revealed promising applicability of Conformal Prediction in transfer learning scenarios.
